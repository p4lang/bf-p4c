/**
 * @ingroup common
 * @brief Merge POV bits where a single POV bit could be shared between multiple headers
 *
 * Identify situations where a single POV bit could be shared across multiple headers. "Merge" the
 * POV bits by replacing with the single POV bit target in the deparser.
 *
 * This pass is currently fairly simple: it only replaces references in the deparser. Ideally it
 * would replace all references as this would save some POV bits and could help with PHV fitting.
 *
 * I had experimented with more complete POV replacement throughout the pipe but halted those
 * changes. There are several places where more extensive changes are required for a more full
 * replacement:
 *  - Header mutex analysis: Logic doesn't account for aliased POV bits, so a manipulation of an
 *    alias source doesn't register as updating the alias destination and vice-versa.
 *  - Usedef: Logic doesn't account for aliased POV bits.
 *  - IXBar + hash: If two POV bits that are merged are used in a hash, the bits still need to be
 *    included twice. Currently the compiler will duplicate the byte in the IXBar (once for source
 *    and once for dest), but the assembler doesn't currently handle this correctly. Can either
 *    allow the byte duplication (consuming more IXBar resources) and update the assembler, or
 *    eliminate the duplication in the compiler but this requires allowing duplicate bit refences in
 *    IXBar::Use::Byte objects.
 *  - IXBar + match: Requires either the byte duplication on the ixbar, or duplication of bytes on
 *    the match bus. (Either choice consumes additional resources of one type or another.)
 *
 * The current approach of only replacing the POV in the deparser avoids the problems listed above.
 * However, it must be run after code elimination, otherwise set valid/set invalid calls may be
 * eliminated and then header mutex analysis breaks.
