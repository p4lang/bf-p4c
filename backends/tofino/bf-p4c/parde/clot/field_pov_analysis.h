/* This pass is a parser data flow analysis to find if a field is extracted from
 * the packet in every path that sets the field's valid bit. If there exists a path
 * where valid bit is set but no fields of the corresponding header is extracted
 * from the packet then such fields should not be placed in clots.
 *
 * The analysis proceeds in topological sorted order.
 * Every state has two bitvectors :
 *    1. field_vec : Contains fields that are definitely extracted from the packet before
 *                   the current state
 *    2. pov_vec : Valid bits that are set before the current state and are waiting for
                   corresponding fields to be extracted.
 *
 * The current state will add a field in its field_vec if any of these conditions are met:
 *    1. Field is extracted from the packet in the current state
 *    2. The field is present in all the immediate predecessors' field_vec
 *
 * Subsequently, the current state will add a valid bit in its pov_vec if
 * any of these conditions are met:
 *     1. The valid bit is set in current state and the field is not present in the
          field_vec of the current state
 *     2. Valid bit is set in any immediate predecessors' pov_vec and the field is not present
 *        in the field_vec for the current state.
 *
 * If the current state transitions to end, then the povbits that are set in pov_vec
 * are added in pov_extracted_without_fields.
