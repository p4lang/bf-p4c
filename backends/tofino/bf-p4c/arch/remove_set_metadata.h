/**
 * Removes assignments to metadata fields in the egress parser.
 *
 * In v1model, the values metadata fields have at the end of the ingress thread
 * are serialized into a hidden header which is sent to the egress thread along
 * with the real packet. That hidden header is then deserialized to initialize
 * the same metadata fields in the egress thread. These metadata fields are
 * collectively called "bridged metadata".
 *
 * This process can introduce conflicts if the bridged fields are also written
 * to elsewhere in the egress parser. Since the user can't write their own
 * egress parser in v1model, the compiler has to be responsible for dealing with
 * this problem. We eliminate the potential for conflict by removing assignments
 * to metadata fields from the egress parser.
 *
 * There is one exception to the rule: writes to metadata which is declared
 * local to the parser isn't removed. Because such metadata doesn't escape the
 * parser, it couldn't be bridged in any case, and removing it would
 * unnecessarily restrict both the user and the transformations that the
 * compiler can perform.
 *
 * @pre All parsers are inlined, the program has been transformed to use the
 * TNA architecture, and the refMap is current.
 * @post Assignments to non-parser-local metadata fields are removed from the
 * egress parser.
