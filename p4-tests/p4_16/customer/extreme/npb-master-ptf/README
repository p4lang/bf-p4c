Some pseudo-documentation on how to update this directory.

  Q: If I wanted to update the Extreme packet tests, do I just dump *.p4 into
     npb-master-ptf and *.py into npb-master-ptf/tests?

  A: this is what I did - cd nbp-master-ptf/tests && rm -rf *.py

     and updated their p4_pipelines/pipeline_npb/tst/regr/sanity_vcpFw_intel/symlinks.sh
     to copy python files in tests folder rather than symlink to this folder,
     also copy the python files in p4_pipelines/tst/basic/mau to tests folder

     note that whatever commented is left out..

     and cd scripts/run_custom_tests/patches/scapy and update if there are any
     new files/changes in the corresponding scapy directory in their package

     for p4, copy the entire p4_pipelines and p4_programs to src folder

     for ports.json, copy the entire cfg folder

     for test.json copy p4_pipelines/pipeline_npb/tst/cfg/test.json to tests folder

     and update test_mau_tb file references of test.json to the appropriate absolute path

     only for python -> we need to do this, as I had some old tests from the
     previous instance not in the newer version - which caused interface errors
     and all the subsequent tests failed
