Some pseudo-documentation on how to update this directory.

  Q: If I wanted to update the Extreme packet tests, do I just dump *.p4 into
     npb-master-ptf and *.py into npb-master-ptf/tests?

  A: this is what I did - cd nbp-master-ptf/tests && rm -rf *.py

     and updated their sanity_barefoot/symlinks.sh to copy python files rather
     than symlink to this folder

     note that whatever commented is left out..

     and cd scripts/run_custom_tests/patches/scapy and update if there are any
     new files/changes in the corresponding scapy directory in their package

     for p4, what you do is right

     only for python -> we need to do this, as I had some old tests from the
     previous instance not in the newer version - which caused interface errors
     and all the subsequent tests failed
