# Visual Studio Code + Jarvis Docker Image

This is a short how-to which helps you to set-up the development environment
built from the official Jarvis docker image. The development is based on freely
available tools.

The current setup has been tested on:

Laptop:
* Windows 10
* MacOS 10.15 Catalina

Development VM:
* Ubuntu 18.04

**Required Tools**:

* Laptop
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * SSH: SSH in WSL or native SSH in Windows/MacOS
* Server
  * Docker with pulled `amr-registry.caas.intel.com/bxd-sw/jarvis:latest` image

### Main Idea

The main idea is simple: create a docker image running an SSH server which
allows connection from Visual Studio Code via [Remote SSH
plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).  To achieve this we
need to solve:

* File permissions of bind folder (repository).
* Semi-automatic building of the Docker image.
* How to start the image and export environment variables from the standard
  Jarvis image.
* Start with the zip archive downloading with Dockerfile and similar stuff.

## How to build & use the image

This process builds a Docker image that contains the necessary development
tools, the SSH server, and a script to start the SSH server within the
container.

There is also a support script which can be used for the automatic start of the
SSH server. You can also edit it to mount corresponding folders. Several
examples can be found in the `examples` subdirectory. For example, Pavel's is:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
docker run \
        --rm --user root \
        --privileged \
        -p 2222:22 \
        -v ~/reps:/mnt/reps \
        -v ~/tasks:/mnt/tasks \
        -v ~/docker/user-home/ccache:/home/$USER/.ccache \
        -v ~/docker/user-home/vscode-server:/home/$USER/.vscode-server \
        -v ~/docker/user-home/local:/home/$USER/.local \
        -it jarvis-ssh \
        /bin/bash
```

The base docker image can be obtained as described
[here](https://github.com/barefootnetworks/P4/wiki/Building-and-testing-bf-p4c-compilers-in-docker#setting-updocker-and-docker-hub)
(you need access to the group's Docker Hub).

Now, we are ready to prepare the Docker image based on the Jarvis image.  It is
also a good idea to remove the already built image if you are doing a rebuild.

Steps to build the image:

1. Pull the standard Jarvis image:

```bash
docker pull amr-registry.caas.intel.com/bxd-sw/jarvis)
```

2. Optional: Edit the Dockerfile if you wish to add additional packages to install.

3. Run the `build-image.sh` script:

```bash
./build-image.sh
```

The script builds a new image which contains tools used by Visual Studio Code
(e.g., an updated cmake), an ssh server, and your .ssh/authorized\_keys file.
The authorized\_keys file allows you to login to the container without a
password (if you are using the SSH key authentication for login to your VM :-) ).

The script also creates a set of SSH host keys which will be installed in every
image you build with this script. This eliminates the need to edit your
known\_hosts file every time you rebuild the image.

Check with the docker image command if the `jarvis-ssh` image is available. The default path for your repos is `~/reps` but you can
change the path if you need (edit the `run-jarvis-ssh` script, or see the exmaples in the `examples` directory).
The default `run-jarvis-ssh` script mounts the local `~/reps` intowill be mounted to `/mnt/reps` folder inside the docker image.
The set username is the part of the `sudo` group inside the image, default password is `docker` (if you don't change it).
The build script also takes care about the permission and proxy setup.

Start the image with the `./run-jarvis-ssh` script (or your modified version of the script). The script starts the docker image and
maps the docker image port 22 to localhost port 2222. SSH server inside the docker image is ran automatically.
Thanks to the provided from mapping localhost:22 to docker:22, ssh to docker image should be available now.
You can check if the SSH server runs using command (from machine where docker runs):

```bash
ssh -p 2222 localhost
```

### How to Update the Image

Update process is as similar as the build image but you need to pull the image before the call of the `build-image.sh`.

## Local Configuration

The ssh connection to docker image is working. We need to setup our local environment now.

1. Install the Visual Studio Code, start it, click on extensions and install the Remote - SSH (more details [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).
Restart the Visual Studio Code, press CTRL+P and select connect to the host, click on Configure SSH hosts. Configure the proxy:
`File` --> `Preferences` --> `Settings`, type `proxy` and insert the proxy settings.

2. We need to setup a port forwarding which forwards the local port 2222 to remote port 2222 where the ssh in jarvis-ssh image will be
listening. The template for your setup is following (use the real TAB key instead of the \<TAB\> ):

```
host SSHToDockerImage
<TAB>Hostname 127.0.0.1
<TAB>Port 2222
<TAB>User yourUserName
<TAB>Compression yes
<TAB>ServerAliveInterval 60
```

3. You need to have an option for login to your VM with forwarded ports, another configuration (letâ€™s say from the WSL or your favorite SSH client):

```
host HostForRemoteVScode
<TAB>HostName yourIP
<TAB>LocalForward 2222 localhost:2222
<TAB>User yourUserName
<TAB>ServerAliveInterval 240
<TAB>Compression y
```

After adding both hosts to your local ssh config file, use the console (I am using the WSL) and login to your VM. This creates the
SSH tunnel from your local machine to the docker image. For example:

_Terminal 1:_

```bash
ssh HostForRemoteVScode
```

_Terminal 2:_

```bash
ssh SSHToDockerImage
```

4. The connection from a local machine to docker image should be working now. Back to the Visual Studio Code, press `CTRL+P`, select
`Connect to remote host` and select the host with `SSHToDockerImage`. You should be connected to SSH inside the Docker - it will take
some time until the vscode server is downloaded. The next step is to download several plugins to be able
to program in C++ & use cmake (you can also tune & share your own set of required plugins) - all plugins needs to be installed
on remote machine:

    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools

5. Setup the proxy if the download is not working but this configuration should be taken from the user configuration which was done in
the previous step. Restart the vscode. Now, you have to be ready to open the folder with your repository which is mounted
in `/mnt/reps` folder. Click `File` --> `Preferences Setting`, click on `Remote`, `Extensions`, `C/C++` and make
the following configuration:

* Cpp Standard - select the language standard (mine is C++14)
* Intelli Sense Mode - select the mode (mine is gcc-x64)

6. Open the folder, and enjoy your Visual Studio Code running inside the docker image.

That's it, no additional configuration of the build system is needed if you are fine with default options. You will also need to
reconfigure the image if you are using it for the first time (we have different paths, etc.).

We are done. Compilation, debugging and tests should be working now.

## Building projects in VSCode

VSCode allows project building and you can even have multiple build targets for your project.

1. In your workspace (the folder in which your project resides) create `.vscode` folder and inside of it create `tasks.json`. Your file explorer in VSCode should now look similar to this:
```
|-- Workspace
    |-- WorkspaceFolder
        |-- .vscode
        |   |-- tasks.json
        |-- bf-p4c-compilers
```

2. Inside the `tasks.json` file you can now put your build tasks (exact info is in the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks)), and it can look something like this:
```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "standard make -j76",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "make -j76",
            "group": "build",
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${fileDirname}/../bf-p4c-compilers/build"
            },
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "always",
                "panel": "new"
            },
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$gcc"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
This configuration file will offer you one build option called `standard make -j76` which will use the command `make -j76` and will execute it in the `bf-p4c-compiler/build` folder.
If you'll be using `make -76` just make sure that you have an access to the build pool (otherwise it would take a lot of time).

3. To build your project with this configuration just press `ctrl + shift + b` and after short while a prompt should pop up containing all the builds added to the `tasks.json` file and here you can simply select the one you want to build with right now (build progress should show up in the VSCode terminal).

## Debugging in VSCode
Just as you can build projects in VSCode, you can also debug right from VSCode.

1. In your workspace (just as in case of building) create `.vscode` folder and inside of it create file `launch.json`. Your file explorer in VSCode should now look similar to this:
```
|-- Workspace
    |-- WorkspaceFolder
        |-- .vscode
        |   |-- launch.json
        |   |-- tasks.json
        |-- bf-p4c-compilers
```

2. Inside the `launch.json` file you can now put your configuration (exact info is in the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) and a tutorial on debugging in VSCode is [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/introvideos-cpp)). `launch.json` can look something like this:
```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "(gdb) p4c-barefoot",
            "type": "cppdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bf-p4c-compilers/build/p4c/extensions/bf-p4c/p4c-barefoot",

            "args": ["--std=p4-16", "--target=tofino", "--arch=tna", "/home/ubuntu/issueFolder/someP4File.p4pp"],
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "cwd": "/home/ubuntu/issueFolder/folderForOutputsOfP4CBarefoot",

            "environment": [],
            "externalConsole": false,
            "MIMode": "gdb",
            "setupCommands": [
                {
                    "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                    "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                    "ignoreFailures": true
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "(gdb) bfas",
            "type": "cppdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bf-p4c-compilers/build/bf-asm/bfas",

            "args": ["/home/ubuntu/issueFolder/someBFAFile.bfa"],
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "cwd": "/home/ubuntu/issueFolder/folderForOutputsOfBFA",

            "environment": [],
            "externalConsole": false,
            "MIMode": "gdb",
            "setupCommands": [
                {
                    "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                    "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                    "ignoreFailures": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
This configuration file sets up 2 debug options -- the first is for `p4c-barefoot` and the second one is for `bfas`. Path to these is specified in the `"program"` attribute and arguments with which it will be executed are in `"args"` attribute. So when you need to debug with different input arguments and files, this attribute has to be changed. Also you'll most likely want to change the `"cwd"` attribute to suit your setup as well.

3. Make sure you have the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) installed, otherwise install it.

4. You can now use `F5` which will run the target application or alternatively click the debug icon in the Activity bar (or press `ctrl+shift+d`) and in the top left of the panel next to `RUN AND DEBUG` select one of your debugging configurations.

5. To run this debug simply click on the green start symbol (after creating some breakpoints by clicking on the space next to line number or by using the `F9` shortcut) and after little while the debug should start and it's output will be visible in the `DEBUG CONSOLE` tab same as additional information. Also a small control panel with debugging control should appear.

### Alternative Approach

Using Remote Containers extension is another way of opening your workspace in a container. This approach can re-use the existing Dockerfile mentioned above and directly invoke it to open it in a docker container. This bypasses the SSH configuration and port forwarding required in the above step.

## Step 1 - Install Extension

In VSCode, go to Extensions and search for "Remote - Containers". Install this extension.

## Step 2 - Connect to Remote Host

In the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) click on "Remote SSH : Connect to Host" and click on 'HostForRemoteVScode'. Initial part of the main approach walks through configuring the SSH connection to connect to remote VM.

## Step 3 - Open Workspace Folder

Click on Open Folder and open the checked out repo in the remote VM

## Step 4 - Add devcontainer.json file

If not already present, create a '.devcontainer' folder in the top level repo directory and add a devcontainer.json file.

Sample contents for json file,

```
{
	"name": "Jarvis",
	"image": "amr-registry.caas.intel.com/bxd-sw/jarvis:latest",
	"build": {
		"context": "..",
		"args": {
		}
	},
    "runArgs": [
		"--privileged"
	],
	"extensions": [
		"ms-vscode.cpptools",
		"ms-vscode.cmake-tools"
	]
}
```
Note,
- 'context' parameter gives the location of context folder for building the image
- Instead of 'image' you can use the 'dockerfile' parameter as follows:
```
	"build": {
		"dockerfile": "../docker/vscode_docker/Dockerfile",
		"context": "..",
		"args": {},
        "target": "jarvis-vscode"
	},
```
   While this is another way to build the container, the former approach seems faster and can also be configured in the same way as the Dockerfile by adding a 'postCreateCommand'.

See Devcontainer.json reference for customization can be found here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference

## Step 5 - Run folder in docker container

Open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and click on "Remote Containers - Open Folder in Container". 
VScode searches for the devcontainer.json file and runs the linked Dockerfile to build the image. Once the image is built, a container is automatically started and terminal will be available for use inside the container.

The repo folder is mapped to /workspaces/<repo> by default. devcontainer.json can be customized based on user preferences.

Enjoy!
